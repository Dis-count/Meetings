1. Annual summary

I think the main problem is that I didn't position myself rightly before, but right now I want to tell myself a sencence: You were not able to success if you dared not to struggle just because you were afraid of failure.

Sometimes I will lose my target, then don't know what to do. I will gradually lose control and not be strict with myself anymore.

I've tried to improve myself in many ways, but it seems to make no difference to me.
Professor Liu has set a good example for us, and has provided enough help and guidance for my work.

So I have nothing to blame but myself, I hope I can try my best to realize what I want next year.
And I will improve my work efficiency by increasing my focus and investing enough time.
