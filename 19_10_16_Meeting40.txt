1. Consider this MIP problem

min   cx
s.t. Ax \geq B
    A'x \geq B'
x_1 \in {0,1} x_2 \in [0,1]    x=[x_1,x_2]

c \to d  such that  x^0 \to optimal x^*

Find the literatures that describe the inverse problem

2. Utilize the Langrangian to relax some constrains to the objective function.

So we want to adjuct the parameter A and D.

L(\lambda) = min cx + \lambda[A'x-B']
        s.t. Ax \geq B
          x' \in {0,1}

How to adjust \lambda A' to \lambda D' such that  x^0 \to optimal

PLUS the part of theory.

Besides that,

Find the original problem and the reduced formulation.

1. LP \to LP

2. MIP \to LP

3. MIP \to MIP
