1. Likewise, we still consider the inverse general form.

Follow two methods: Lagrange method to obtain the \lambda^* and utilize the inverse optimization. Notice the sequence/order.
And the other one, simultaneously use the Lagrange method and inverse optimization.

Observe the two gaps.


Consider the Linear Production Problem

Consider the relation between weight and \lambda




2. Notice that we consider INVERSE problem made up of the solution and value two forms.
