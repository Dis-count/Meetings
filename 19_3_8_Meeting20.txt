1. How to define these kind of games??(**machine **price)
Condition: m > \frac{n}{2}

2. How to build the connection between the above game and the other situations, and put it as a whole.

That is, 2 \to 3 \to 4 \ldots, they should be the same.

3. Machine schedule is a subadditive, then we can obtain

$ C_0(1) + C_0(3) \ge C_0(1,3) $ and $ C_0(1,3) = P + C_0(1) + C_0(3)

4. Watch out the contact of the general situation and machine schedule.

5. The problem of truncation, that is min{m,\bar{m}}, \bar{m} will do some effect to the curve.
