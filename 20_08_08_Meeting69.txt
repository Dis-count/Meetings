1.  Finish scheduling quickly.

2.  Print out the understandable result: such as what is the time window.

Visualization.

3.  Continue to find relative literature about how to cenima scheduling.  Finished.

4. How to find a scheduling way to show that FIFO is impossible but our way can do.
Set c_{ij} =1, use the time distance to show the difference.
Or our way can provide more efficient scheduling.

Soft constraint  VS  Hard constraint

If the objective function 

5.  For example, 10 people in 200 space need to wait for at least 10 min.  50 people in 200 space need to wait for at least 30 min.

Construct a function about the ratio of population to space.

Mainly consider the impact of time distance on the final scheduling.

FIFO also has to satisfy the space distancing.
