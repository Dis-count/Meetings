We talked about the lessons I learned from the experience of last two years.

I think I have wasted too much time, I lost myself, I don't know the meaning of striving. Gradually I wasted time on other trivial things.

I lost the will of fight, I will think since I gave up my everything two years ago, it doesn't matter whether I continue work hard or not.

It should not be the truth, it is because that I changed my way, so I have to spend more efforts than others to catch what I lost.

Cheer up, don't think about/care about loss or gain too much, focus on the present.
