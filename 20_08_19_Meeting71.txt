Point of view :

-- Don't have a way to compare the FIFO with the distancing when there exist the time windows.

Literature: Inspired by TV scheduling. Very few literature

part I : forecast the parameters.

Use empirical methods to get Demand Input:

1. The movies to be scheduled in that particular week with their running times.

2. Contractual agreements with distributors that certain movies will be
shown in certain screening rooms. Typically, these agreements are
made for newly released movies (1 to 3 per week). These
agreements included the specification of a particular screening
room or a screening room that meets some capacity requirement.

3. Opening and closing times of the theater forweekdays andweekend
days and information about the times required for cleaning screening
rooms between shows.

Demand forecasting:

Forecast for the number of visitors for every movie for each possible
starting time/day combination in the week for which the schedule is
produced.

Results : Compare it to the corresponding, manually constructed schedule.


Part II: Modeling
