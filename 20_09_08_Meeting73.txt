1. Solved the bilinear term, but add another three groups of constraints.

2. The sum of time gap is a constant, we need to find another way to define
   the time distance. Add penalty terms?

3. Space first, find the larest room, and use this room to satisfy the demand at first.

If we use the corresponding policy, the result is very easy to obtain. And each policy will give a lower bound for this problem.

4. Use dynamic programming.

5. That paper difference: (min waiting time) Our object is to (max the distance).
