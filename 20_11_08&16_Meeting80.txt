Useful Literature:

Sommer, R., & Becker, F. D. (1971). Room density and user satisfaction. Environment and Behavior, 3(4), 412–417.

---------------------------------------------
This literature does not demonstrate the relationship between the room size and residents' satisfaction, on the contrary, they assume that there is no relation between them in order to prove the structure and the decoration matter.

---------------------------------------------

Set the value in objective function as a concave function f(p) which is a function with respect to room size p.

How to select the corresponding function when there is no relevant literature for reference?
