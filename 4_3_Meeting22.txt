1. As we know, the slope at the different intervals equals to $m_V-\sum{\rho_s m_s}$.

* When m_s has to be 1, we expand the range of slope values,
(That is $m_V-\sum{\rho_s m_s}$ < $m_V-\sum{\rho_s}$)

so what we obtain is the upper bound of the slope, which will be reflected on the graph

* When m_s has to be m_V,
